# 8th-Edition-Damage-Calc
A text based calculator to run the calculations for defeating an enemy unit in a game of Warhammer 40,000's 8th Edition


Program was written and designed in May 2017 for CIS 122 - Intro to Programming Logic, a course taught at Portland Community College.
Format of the program is psuedocode in blocks for each function, followed by the actual python code.
A test case is also provided to verify how I tested the program's accuracy.

Formulae were generated by reading the daily updates at Warhammer Community, which allowed me to create this program before 8th actually launches.

Any and all testing will be greatly appreciated!
